# non-descript-blogsite
Final project for Web Design and Development course where I created a content management system. JavaScript server side scripting is used with Node.js and Express.js along with EJS. The blog posts and admin login details are stored in a MongoDB database. The WYSIWYG editor used is TinyMCE. 

The admin can add a new page with an image and text content, which will be displayed in the navigation menu. They are also able to delete or edit a published post. Sessions are tracked, hence, someone who is not logged in will not be able to access the admin dashboard.
